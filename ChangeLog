Next version (not released yet)

  * Parse identifiers declared as &xxx, where "xxx" may be a reserved word.
  * Possibility to specify additional files using -A or --additional
    (just like introduction or conclusion, but you can provide any number
    of items) (thanks to Alex Merkel)
  * Added de.utf8 (German with UTF-8 encoding)
  * Automatically remove %region and %endregion from comments
  * Show visibility (public, protected, private...) inside records too
    (it is meanigful for advanced records)
  * Implement in pasdoc_gui options to
    - customize HTML head and body
    - set external descriptions file
    - configure identifiers excluded from auto-linking
  * Rename "internal" to "nested" to describe this language feature.
    Because that is how it's called in official docs
    ( http://docwiki.embarcadero.com/RADStudio/Tokyo/en/Nested_Type_Declarations,
      https://www.freepascal.org/docs-html/ref/refse41.html )
    and the "internal" word has traditionally different meaning
    ("something not supposed to be visible/used from the outside").
  * The automatic tests are now easier to run and check (see tests/README.md).
  * @raises and @param is not supported at properties as well as methods.
    (Actually, it's supported at everything now,
    but it makes sense only at properties and methods now.)
  * Tipue (client-side search, see https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/UseTipueSearchOption )
    was much improved:
    - we have upgraded to use Tipue 6.1, which highlights the found terms
    - we strip HTML from Tipue index, which makes the "search results" page correct
  * Fix handling SVN fixed-length $Date::
  * Parsing of $if and $elseif expressions,
    like "defined(MSWINDOWS) or defined(UNIX)"

2018-02-08 v0.15.0

  * @links to enumerated type members work now.
  * New @includeCode tag https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/IncludeCodeTag
    (by Silvio Clécio)
  * @longCode and @preformatted improved to better honor indentation.
  * parsing "experimental" directive.
  * Allow to customize HTML output more, with your own CSS and HTML, by
    --html-head, --html-body-begin, --html-body-end command-line params.
  * HTML output is now HTML5.
  * Add our tools to the binary release: pascal_pre_proc (Pascal preprocessor),
    file_to_pascal_data, file_to_pascal_string.
  * Improve CSS and HTML, in particular for accessibility and mobile browsers.
    Among many improvements, we removed fixed font size in pixels,
    changed some tables into divs, and fixed HTML validity around Tipue search box.
  * pasdoc_gui uses now default font size on your system.
  * Updated Spanish (Spain) translation (by Guillermo Martínez Jiménez)
  * Tipue works now more efficiently -- the (potentially large) "index data"
    is only loaded on the "Search Results" page.
  * Automatic tests rearrangements and simplifications (see tests/run_all_tests.sh).

  Authors: Michalis Kamburelis and contributors mentioned above (thank you!).

    Use "--verbosity 3" to show it.
  * Brazilian utf8 translation (by Alexsander da Rosa)

2005-11-26 v0.10.0

  + New command-line options:
    --auto-link
      (see [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/AutoLinkOption])
    --implicit-visibility
      (see [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/ImplicitVisibilityOption])
    --no-macro
      (see [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/NoMacroOption])
  + New @-tags:
    @bold and @italic
      (see [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/BoldAndItalicTags])
    @seealso
      (see [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/SeeAlsoTag])
    @inheritedClass
      (see [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/InheritedClassnameNameTag])
    @preformatted (by Ascanio Pressato)
      (see [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/PreformattedTag])
    @orderedList, @unorderedList, @definitionList,
      @item, @itemLabel, @itemSpacing, @itemSetNumber
      (see [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/ListTags])
    @table, @row, @rowHead, @cell
      (see [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/TableTags])
    @noAutoLinkHere, @noAutoLink
      (see [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/AutoLinkOption])
    @tableOfContents
      (see [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/TableOfContentsTag])
  * Dashes rules: em-dash, en-dash, short dash, "@-"
    (see [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/WritingDocumentation])
  * FPC macros are now correctly parsed by pasdoc.
  * Each detailed description in HTML output is enclosed within gray frame
  * Various fixes. E.g.
    * --spell-check-ignore-words works now.
    * @links to @anchors and @sections work always now.
  * Many improvements to pasdoc_gui (by Richard B. Winston and Michalis)
  * back-comments
    (see [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/WhereToPlaceComments#head-7ce7157fefbd0d84d3577aa636f758baa813e201])

  Some compatibility had to be broken:
  * New dashes rules break compatibility. But actually previous
    behavior with regards to dashes was broken, because "-"
    was just always directly copied to output. So previously
    in HTML "-" always meant just a short dash (there was no
    way to write en-dash or em-dash). And in LaTeX
    "---"/"--"/"-" meant em-dash/en-dash/short dash,
    but there was no way to escape it (i.e. there was no "@-"
    construct).
  * Back-comments feature breaks compatibility if you have comments
    that have as their exact 1st character "<". Now they will be
    interpreted as back-comments (assigned to previous item
    with "<" stripped). To fix your docs, just add
    a space inside such problematic comment right before "<".

  Authors: features above not explicitly marked by author were
  done by Michalis Kamburelis.

2005-07-09 v0.9.0

  End-user visible changes:
  + New command-line options:

    --introduction and --conclusion
      (see [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/IntroductionAndConclusion])
    --latex-head
      (see appropriate part of [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/CommandLine])
    --link-gv-uses and --link-gv-classes
      (see [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/GraphVizSupport])
    --link-look
      (see [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/LinkLookOption])
    --sort
      (see [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/SortOption])
    --use-tipue-search
      (see [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/UseTipueSearchOption])
    --version
      (see appropriate part of [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/CommandLine])
  + New @-tags:
    @br
      (see [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/BrTag])
    @latex
      (see [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/LatexTag])
    @section, @anchor, @title, @shorttitle tags in introduction/conclusion
      (see [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/IntroductionAndConclusion])
    @deprecated
      (see [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/DeprecatedTag])
    @value and @member
      (see [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/MemberValueTag])
  + pasdoc_gui, a GUI alternative to console pasdoc version.
  + Spell checking (see [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/SpellChecking])
  * Cache is now independent from output format
    (see [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/CacheOption])
  * Many fixes and improvements to HTML output,
    it's now structured a little more consistently,
    it's more configurable by CSS,
    it's 100% conforming HTML 4.01 Transitional.
  * Many fixes and improvements to LaTeX output,
    it's also structured more consistently,
    and it doesn't omit undocumented items
    (see the bottom of [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/WritingDocumentation]).
  * @longcode improvements:
    it's now formatted in LaTeX output,
    the look of float and hex values inside @longcode in HTML output
    is configurable by CSS.
  * Parsing improvements:
    * Better full declaration of items is now displayed in documentation
    * FPC overloaded operators are now parsed
    * Delphi hint directives (deprecated, platform, library) are now parsed
  * You don't have to enclose tag parameters in parenthesis
    (see [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/TagsParametersWithoutParenthesis])
  * Many many other small fixes and improvements.

  Many internal improvements, like:
  + We maintain a large set of tests (regression tests,
    conformance tests etc.) in pasdoc sources
    (see tests/README file in pasdoc sources and
    [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/RegressionTesting]).

  Documentation:
    You can find the most complete and up-to-date documentation
    of pasdoc features in our wiki, [http://pasdoc.sourceforge.net/].
    Unfortunately, with pasdoc 0.9.0, offline documentation
    (previously in docs/ directory of released archives) is no longer
    provided, this is intended to be fixed in future releases
    (see [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/ToDoOfflineDocs]).

  Some compatibility had to be broken:
  * pasdoc.css will be always overwritten when you generate HTML documentation.
    You must use --css command-line option
    (see [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/CssOption])
    if you want to use your custom css.
  * By default no items are sorted.
    You must use --sort command-line option
    (see [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/SortOption])
    if you want to change this.
  * @links look now a little different, see
    [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/LinkLookOption] and
    [https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/wiki/LinkTag],
    use --link-look=stripped if you really need old behavior.

  Authors: many. See @author tags at the beginning of pasdoc 0.9.0 units.

2004-07-12 v0.8.8.1 to v0.8.8.3 Johannes Berg, others
 + applied a bunch of patches that were floating around on the mailing list
 + some code cleanup

2004-05-06 v0.8.8 Johannes Berg, Richard B Winston, Carl Eric Codere
 + fix a lot of tiny bugs, range check errors, etc
 + implement consolidation for // style comments so that you can now
   use // style comments in multiple lines like this:
   // @abstract(something)
   // and a real comment
   and both lines will be added to the documentation.
 + @longcode tag implemented (fixes bug #802469)
 + \LaTeX output

2003-11-20 v0.8.8-pre6 Johannes Berg
 + fix 3 logged bugs
   [ pasdoc-Bugs-842325 ] bug in function IsMacro
   [ pasdoc-Bugs-844324 ] tag "returns" very together does not insert a jump of line
   [ pasdoc-Bugs-844325 ] The tag "return" does not work, "returns" with "s" if
 + corrected output of @raises tag (last character could be cut off)
 + javi fixed and updated the Spanish translation
 + added proper warning for FPC operator overloading as it is not supported
   right now. TODO item: write a ParseOperator function
 + added support for FreePascal inline "calling convention"

2003-08-04 v0.8.8-pre5 Johannes Berg
 * more CSS, completely new style

2003-05-14 v0.8.8-pre4 Thomas Mueller
 + more CSS
 + code cleanup
 + if class has no description, write ancestor's description and
   a warning
 + reordering by visibility
 + @param, @returns, @raises except argument in parentheses now

2003-05-09 v0.8.8-pre3 Thomas Mueller/Johannes Berg
 + write complete known hierarchy in class descriptions
 - remove calling hhc.exe, you should do this from a script
 + fixed HTML-Help output
 + fixed numeric name creation wrt. cross-links
   (there was a rather BAD bug, now all numbers are
    sequential too!)
 + automatically turn on numeric filenames for HTML help because
   hhc chokes on extra dots in filenames
 + bugfix: "~" is a valid character in a URL

2003-05-02 v0.8.8-pre2 Thomas Mueller/Johannes Berg
 + better HTML output with CSS
 + HTML output has new section links
 + fix hierarchy: objects descend from TObject,
   interfaces with GUID are now shown properly

2003-05-01 v0.8.8-pre1 Thomas Mueller/Johannes Berg
 + hierarchy is shown properly with everything
 + name directive for imported functions parsed properly
 + proper HTML entity encoding

2003-04-20 v0.8.7 Johannes Berg/Thomas Mueller
Based on Ralf Junker's changes, I did the following:
 + added enumerated type parsing
 + made work with FPC
 + records (handled like classes),
   + case statements in records
   + nested records
 + spell-checker for linux (currently disabled, use an older CVS file
   of RunHelp to use under Kylix, will not work in FPC, need advice)
 + new option-parser
 + uses delphi streams instead of files. Supposedly does not work
   on all platforms FPC runs on - need advice
 + commentmarker (for example only {: comments )
 + declarations like
   "var a: function(x,y,z:Integer):Integer cdecl = nil"
   are parsed correctly
 + dependency plotting with GraphViz (AT&T )
   (not very useful)
 + uses clause will be included in doc (optional)
 + links "http://", "ftp://" etc. are recognized automatically
 + varargs directive
 + abbreviations "@author(johannes)" can be expanded
   to @author(Johannes Berg <...>) via abbreviatons file
 + @cvs($Date ...$), @cvs($Author ...$) is recognized and
   used for lastmod / author
   + duplicate authors skipped
 - name search doesn't look into classes any more,
   if a method reference is needed outside the current class
   then the class has to be specified:
   @link(class.method)
   (faster and less error-prone)
 + HTML output uses unitname.classname.html instead of numbers,
   but has option to make number-only-filenames (for short-name
   filesystems)
 + class member visibility can be specified in output
 + long option names (see PasDoc --help)
 + images are no longer carried in a .RES file but in include
   files instead, as constants in code, for FPC

Some time inbetween... (0.6.21 to 0.8.6) Ralf Junker
 - LaTeX documentation removed
 - see http://zeitungsjunge.de/delphi/PasDoc/History.htm for

- added Rodrigo Jardim's translations of pasdoc's output to Brasilian
  Portuguese; new switch -b (and --brasilian)
- increased STEP from 32 to 128 when reallocating description pointers,
  this makes pasdoc crash less with RTE 216; bug must still be fixed by
  changing GetMem's default behaviour

2000/04/17 v0.6.19 ms
- fixed bug that prevented pasdoc from skipping code until an $else
  conditional directive (thanks to Michael v. Canneyt for reporting
  this bug)

  gendoc.TDocGenerator
- worked on external description file loading
- email addresses in author tags are now displayed as mailto links in HTML
  output
- hard-coded HTML colors in body element (already added colors for tables
  etc., as long as the whole thing is not CSS-based, it's better to have
  all colors defined so that unusual default colors of a browser won't ruin
  the overall impression)
- released 0.6.15

2000/04/08 v0.6.13 ms
- released 0.6.13

2000/04/06 v0.6.13 ms

  I am unable to trace; Delphi 5 compiles pasdoc without problems but crashes when
  running it on appinfo.pas between the second and third constant for no apparent
  reason; I will try to fix bugs that are more obvious in the near future...
- fixed bug that made default keyword after a property appear as a field of that class
  (thanks to Andre Jager for pointing this out)
- fixed bug that made pasdoc crash on an empty author tag: @author()
  (thanks to Michael Hess for finding and isolating (!) this!)
- made pasdoc skip property declaration; property parsing needs some work,
  I will do this soon

2000/04/03 v0.6.11 ms
- created sourceforge.net account; pasdoc is now at http://pasdoc.sourceforge.net
- modified homepage to have frames; single page has become too huge

2000/03/31 v0.6.11 ms

  react on them with an error message
- received pasdoc DOS binaries sent in by Jean-Pierre Vial and created a 0.6.9
  DOS binaries release, then updated the homepage
- added IOResult check in TFileInputStream.Open in filestre.pas; no more crashing
  on non-existent files

- cleaned up TDocGenerator
- moved STATE_xxx constants from unit Parsing to Items

1999/07/29 v0.6.1 ms
- rewrote part to support different output languages
  (TDocGenerator.GetString now calls TDocGenerator.GetStringEnglish
   etc., each language gets its own GetStringXXXX function)
- integrated Jean Dit Bailleul's French translation

1999/04/27 v0.6.0 ms
- added support for directive file switch -f

1999/04/18 v0.6.0 ms
- added support for getting ancestor list in objects / classes
  and skipping interface ID in Delphi-4-type interfaces;
  now Delphi 4 d4system.pas and d4sysuti.pas are parsed flawlessly!

1999/03/11 v0.6.0 ms
- replaced platform.inc with version from latest FV snapshot to detect
  Delphi 4
- added CompVer unit to store compiler name / OS / bits
- moved TItem and descendants to new unit Items
- started adding support for interfaces (Delphi 3.0+ feature)
- added a stripped-down version of Objects to work with Delphi
  (Delphi command line compiler dcc32 now compiles pasdoc, but
   execution results in runtime error 103 at the beginning);
  don't use this Objects for anything else, only TCollection, TObject
  and TSortedCollection (IIRC) will be used!

????/??/?? v0.5.? ms
- added test.pas to test pasdoc functionality
- changed switches to one letter
- added --version and --help switches
- added -d switch to specify conditional directive on command line
- added new units Scanning and Tokenizi for decent support of
  conditional compiler directives
- created a basic pasdoc.tex file that will be the manual
- added applications pastype, pasdep and pasconv (no functionality yet)
  which will use the Scanning unit

1999/02/25 v0.5.2 ms
- moved TPasDoc from parsing.pas to pasdoc.pas
- added fields Language, DestDir and Units to TDocGenerator

1999/02/24 v0.5.2 ms
- created scanning.pas

1999/02/22 v0.5.2 ms
- unit Parsing exceeded 3000 lines of code, so I
  moved TText from unit Parsing to new unit Texts

1999/02/11 v0.5.1 ms
- fixed several bugs
  - HTML links
  - property parsing
  - class parsing
  - some changes in tex generator
- added support for German docs

1998/12/10 v0.5.0 ms
- added "nogeneratorinfo" switch

1998/12/09 v0.5.0 ms
- continued work on ExpandDescription

1998/12/08 v0.5.0 ms
- first entry in this history file
- restarted work on pasdoc after 2-3 months...
- now pasdoc can only create one type of output each time it gets called,
  not multiple
- TGenDoc.WriteDescription copies all data byte-wise to output stream;
  replacing of links and special characters is done in additional
  procedure TPasDoc.ExpandDescriptions to be called after
  TDocGenerator.BuildLinks and before TDocGenerator.WriteDocumentation
