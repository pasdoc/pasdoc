  <description><detailed>Testcase was causing a bug before this fix: https://github.com/pasdoc/pasdoc/commit/00c4e66ae1962398ff4f2ed76fbb2facbfaf84c0 In this case, class has an ancestor, but for PasDoc the ancestor type is not &quot;CIO&quot;, as it's an alias (and potentially, PasDoc doesn't even know the unit with it, so it really cannot determine it's CIO).</detailed></description>
