## Description
This is another test unit that includes ok\_relative\_include\_conf.inc file two times.

This time note that the ok\_relative\_include\_conf.inc file is already in the parent directory of this unit file, so once again **no matter what is current dir when running pasdoc** --- you should not need to add any -I option to pasdoc to find ok\_relative\_include\_conf.inc.<span id="PasDoc-Uses"/>
