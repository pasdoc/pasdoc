## Description
This is a test unit that includes ok\_relative\_include\_conf.inc file two times.

Note that the ok\_relative\_include\_conf.inc file is in the same directory as this unit, so **no matter what is current dir when running pasdoc** --- you should not need to add any -I option to pasdoc to find ok\_relative\_include\_conf.inc.<span id="PasDoc-Uses"/>
