## Description
Testing of parsing and making docs for records with case parts.</p>
<p>


It does not pass properly yet: 

1. Types for fields in record case are not printed (because parser does not set their FullDeclaration properties).

1. Also, CaseTwoB field has no description (but it should have &quot;Description of CaseTwoA and CaseTwoB&quot;)





Update 2005-10-17: now this test passes OK, both problems above are solved.<span id="PasDoc-Uses"/>
